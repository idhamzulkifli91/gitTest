Testing
This is new project is use for testing.

The laboratory of Service Design and Engineering will consists of hands-on sessions where we will explore how to implement REST and SOAP web services. Occasionally, we will have brief conceptual introductions or reviews of what was presented in theoretical lectures (for the sake of remembering). Below you will find what you will need to make the most out of each session. You can follow the Video Guides or if you prefer, move directly to the Summary of Environment with the list of tools you need to install in your personal computer.
